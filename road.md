# 가지 않은 길 - Robert Frost

```
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;

    Then took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    Though as for that the passing there
    Had worn them really about the same,
```

<pre>
    And both that morning equally lay
    In leaves no step had trodden black.
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
    I doubted if I should ever come back.

    I shall be telling this with a sigh
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference.
</pre>

문명의 이른 시점에 손쉽게 중력 조작 기술을 터득한 록솔란인들은 은하간 항해를 하며 그저 하던 대로 지구를 침공합니다.
하지만 그 이외의 다른 기술들은 인류보다 한참 덜 떨어진 수준(상당히 개연적)이라서 탈탈 털리고 오히려 중력 조작 기술마저 넘겨주게 되어 인류에게 성간 제국을 건설할 빌미를 제공한 셈이 되어버립니다.
이야기는 록솔란 대위 토그람과 조타수 랜시스크의 다음과 같은 대화로 끝납니다.

> Togram sadly waggled his ears. "It seems so unfair. All that they got, just by not stumbling onto the hyperdrive."

> "They have it now," Ransisc reminded him. "Thanks to us."

> The Roxolani looked at each other, appalled. They spoke together: "What have we done?
